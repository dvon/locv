As I work my way through Adrian Kaehler and Gary Bradski's
[Learning OpenCV 3](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920044765.do)
(an expanded version of their 2008 book, updated for OpenCV 3),
I'm attempting to translate the examples into Python 3.  The
original C++ examples are
[here](https://github.com/oreillymedia/Learning-OpenCV-3_examples).
