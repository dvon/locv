As I read Adrian Kaehler and Gary Bradski's new C++ edition of
their OpenCV book,
[Learning OpenCV 3](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920044765.do),
I'm attempting to translate the examples
into Python 3.  I skipped the chapter 4 examples, since the Python
interface uses NumPy arrays rather than OpenCV's `Mat` data type.
(I'm using this
[NumPy cheat sheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/Numpy_Python_Cheat_Sheet.pdf)
from datacamp.com to try to fill in the gaps as I try to translate
later examples.)
